# Midi OBS what???
This script let's you use a MIDI controller like the Novation Launchpad, Ableton Push, Akai LPD or the Korg nanoPAD to switch scenes, start/stop recording/streaming, control volume/delay/transition time and more in [obs-studio](https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio).

## Requirements

- Obviously a (USB) MIDI controller
- Python 3
- A few pip packages
  - [TinyDB](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb)
  - [mido](https://github.com/olemb/mido)
  - [python-rtmidi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rtmidi)
  - [websocket-client](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client)
- The [obs-websocket plugin](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/releases) (Version >= 4.4.0)
  
## Setup Part 1

- Install Python 3.x.x 
  - On Windows: Make sure you trick "Add Python 3.x to PATH" in the setup
- Make sure you also install pip
- For instructions how to install TinyDB click [here](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-tinydb)

- For instructions how to install websocket-client click [here](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client#installation)

## Setup Part 2 OBS Websocket

- Download the installer and run it
- Start OBS, open the "Tools" menu and select "websocket server settings"
- Make sure that "Enable Websocket server" is checked, "Server Port" is 4444 and "Enable authentification" is unchecked

## Setup Part 3

- [Download the repository](https://github.com/lebaston100/) or clone it
- Connect your MIDI controller
- Launch obs-studio
- Launch the setup.py (Try double click or the "Run Setup.bat" if you are on Windows)
- You will get a list of available MIDI devices. Type the number you want to select and press Enter
- Now you will be asked to press a button or move a fader on your MIDI controller, do that
- If your midi controller sends control change messages, you will also be asked for the type of the input(fader or button)
- Select an action from the list and press enter. The names represent the request-type in obs-websocket
- Depending on the action, you will also be asked for the scene and source name (selecting always works by typing in the number and pressing enter)
- Available for buttons:
  - SetCurrentScene: Switches to the scene
  - SetPreviewScene: Puts a scene into preview when in studio mode
  - TransitionToProgram: Transitions the current preview scene to program
  - SetCurrentTransistion: Sets the transition that is used with SetCurrentScene
  - SetSourceVisibility: Hides or unhides a source
  - ToggleSourceVisibility: Toggles the visibility of a source
  - ToggleMute: Toggles the mute status from a source
  - SetMute: Mutes or unmutes a source
  - StartStopStreaming: Toggles the Streaming
  - StartStreaming: Starts streaming
  - StopStreaming: Stops streaming
  - StartStopRecording: Toggles the Recording
  - StartRecording: Starts recording
  - StopRecording: Stops recording
  - StartStopReplayBuffer: Toggles the replay buffer
  - StartReplayBuffer: Starts the replay buffer
  - StopReplayBuffer: Stops the replay buffer
  - SaveReplayBuffer: Save the replay buffer
  - SetTransitionDuration: Sets the length of the currently selected transistion if supported(fade)(in ms) to a predefined value
  - SetCurrentProfile: Changes to the selected obs profile
  - SetCurrentSceneCollection: Changes to the selected obs scene collection
  - ResetSceneItem: Resets a scene item
  - SetTextGDIPlusText: Sets the text of a GDI text source
  - SetBrowserSourceURL: Sets the url of a BrowserSource
  - ReloadBrowserSource: Reloads a BrowserSource
  
- Available for faders
  - SetVolume: Sets the volume of a source
  - SetSyncOffset: Sets the sync offset of a source(in ns)
  - SetSourcePosition: Sets the x or y position of a source (in px)
  - SetSourceRotation: Sets the rotation of a source (in degree)
  - SetSourceScale: Sets the x or y scale of a source
  - SetTransitionDuration: Sets the length of the currently selected transistion if supported(fade)(in ms)
- Now you can either setup another button/fader by repeating the steps above(except starting the script again) or just close the window to exit the configuration
  
For a detailed description see the [obs-websocket protocol documentation](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/blob/master/docs/generated/protocol.md)
  
### Understanding input scaling

A midi value can be something between 0-127. That is a very limited number.

You will only be asked for Input Scale setup if it's required for the function(SetSourcePosition, SetSourceRotation, SetSourceScale, SetSyncOffset, SetTransitionDuration).

The first value you have to enter(lower output value) is the value that will be sent when the fader is sending a 0. The second value you have to enter(higher output value) is the value that will be sent when the fader is sending a 127. The range between the 2 numbers will be interpolated.

## Sidenotes:

- You can change the IP and Port by modifying the main.py(line 5/6) and setup.py(line 6/7) with a text editor if the scritp is running on another PC on the network. 

## Setting up "macros" (optional):

You can assign unlimited different actions to the same button. This requires editing the config. (Sounds harder then it is)

 - Setup the functions as described above on different buttons
 - Now stop the setup.py and open the config(config.json) with a text editor.
 - Change the "msgNoC" value of the buttons you want to combine to the value of the button you want to use.
 - Here are some pictures for better understanding: [Step 1](https://cdn.lebaston100.de/git/midiobs/miditoobs_1.png) [Step 2](https://cdn.lebaston100.de/git/midiobs/miditoobs_2.png)
 - Now save and close the config file
 - Start main.py and verify that it works

## Using it (!Very important!)

- If you're a first time use make sure to follow setup steps 1-3
  - You can launch setup.py anytime(as long as main.py is not running) to change the configuration of a single button/fader without reconfiguring the whole controller even if you get asked for the controller every time
- Always make sure that obs is running before launching any of the scripts
- Launch the main.py file (Try double click or the "Run Setup.bat" if you are on Windows)
- The console gives you information when it successfully connects to OBS
- Also, if there is an error it will be printed out(If you ignore case sensitive fields or the scene doesn't exist)
- Third, it prints out a message every time you press a button that is setup
- Now just leave it running in the background
- To stop the program simply close the window (on linux kill the task or CTRL + C)

## Troubleshooting

A user has reported that under certain circumstances the script(setup and main) will crash after start on Windows with "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found".
If this happens to you, plase install the Visual C++ Redistributable from Microsoft. Make sure you get the x86 version if you are using python 32bit(Which is default) ([Download](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe))

If you have any other problem, just open a Github issue or DM me @lebaston100 (Twitter/Instagram)
